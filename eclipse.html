<h1>InTrace Eclipse Plugin</h1>

<p>This page describes the InTrace Eclipse plugin. Not sure what InTrace is? Take a look at the <a href="index.html">front page</a>.</p>
<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>I have developed this against Eclipse Helios (3.6.2).</p>
<ul>
<li>Within Eclipse, open Help ? Install New Software</li>
	<li>Enter the following URL: http://intracesite.appspot.com/
	<ul>
<li>This site relies on a free traffic quota. If this site is down you should download the .zip update site: <a href="https://github.com/downloads/mchr3k/org.intrace/intrace.ecl.site.zip">intrace.ecl.site.zip</a>
</li>
		<li>To use this file, click the “Add…” button and then the “Archive…” button and navigate to the downloaded file.</li>

	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Choose the “InTrace Eclipse” plugin</li>
	<li>Click Next and continue until the plugin has been installed</li>
</ul><h2>Using the plugin</h2>
<p>The Eclipse plugin brings the full <a class="internal present" href="/mchr3k/org.intrace/wiki/Docs%3A-InTrace-UI">Docs: InTrace UI</a> into Eclipse and makes it quick and easy to launch java code with the InTrace agent. The following types of launch are currently supported:</p>
<ul>

<li>Java Application</li>
	<li>JUnit Test</li>
</ul><p>Launching is performed using the new “InTrace” lunch button.</p>

<p>Once your program has been started the InTrace UI is opened within eclipse and automatically connects to the running program. The Connection tab of the InTrace UI is hidden as the Eclipse plugin handles the connection automatically.</p>
<p>The InTrace agent pauses the startup of the launched program to allow you to perform any initial configuration of the agent.</p>

<p>When you are ready you should click “Start Program” to resume the normal execution. Any collected trace is shown on the Output tab.</p>

<p>If you close the InTrace window you can open a new one by right clicking the launch from the Debug view and choosing Open InTrace Output.</p>
