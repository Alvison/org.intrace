<h1>3rd Party Issues</h1>

<p><strong>JVM</strong></p>
<p>I have reported to Oracle that the Oracle JVM can't load an agent when the stack size is set to less than 200kb. There is no public bug number for this bug yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE (22/05/2011): This appears to have been fixed at some point. I have tested InTrace on 32 bit Windows 7 running Java 1.6u25 and was able to run with -Xss100k.</p>
