title: InTrace - Roadmap

<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<h2>Recently Done</h2>
<p>(Entries under here get copied to the release note for each release)</p>
</ul><h2>Target for Future Releases</h2>
<ul>
<li>VisualVM
	<ul>
<li>Productise integration</li>
		<li>Launch client with more memory</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2>Other ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compress network output stream – (use mappings for classname, methodname and timestamp)</li>

	<li>Instrument ternary if statements</li>
	<li>improve UTs</li>
	<li>Check how BTrace instruments system classes as mentioned in http://netbeans.dzone.com/articles/debugging-netbeans-with-visualvm-and-btrace
	<ul>
<li>It seems that system classes are only blocked if they have to be classloaded as part of instrumentation</li>
		<li>Need to use jarjar to ensure InTrace has its own private copies of the required classes
		<ul>
<li>Notes – Spent some time trying to get this working and it is entirely non trivial. I don’t care enough about this feature to pursue this any further.</li>
		</ul>
